  "body": "## Synopsis\r\n\r\n**EBODAC** is an open source project created for Clinical Trials, built on the MOTECH platform. It has been deployed for an **EBOLA Vaccine Trial** to run in Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\nMore information on the MOTECH platform is available at the [Motech Project Website](http://motechproject.org). \r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis project provides a framework for implementing clinical trials on the MOTECH Platform. Project partners include the <a href=\"http://www.grameenfoundation.org/\">Grameen Foundation</a> and <a href=\"www.soldevelo.com\">SolDevelo</a>. The EBODAC project is a specific implemntation of MOTECH, allowing for information collection, scheduling and tracking of randomized clinical vaccine trials.\r\n \r\n\r\n## Installation (Linux / Mac / Windows)\r\n### Motech Platform Installation\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install **EBODAC**, you need to first install the [Motech Platform](http://docs.motechproject.org/en/latest/get_started/installing.html). Note that EBODAC is built for MOTECH version 0.27.X.\r\n\r\nDeveloper documentation is also available [here](http://docs.motechproject.org/en/latest/development/dev_setup/dev_install.html), if you'd prefer to build MOTECH yourself.\r\n\r\n### EBODAC Module Dependencies\r\n\r\nThe EBODAC module depends on the MOTECH SMS, IVR, Message-Campaign and CSD modules. You can install them from the Manage Modules section on MOTECH's admin page. Alternatively, you can build each module as described below:\r\n\r\n\r\n`$ git clone https://github.com/motech/modules.git -b 0.27.x --single-branch`\r\n\r\nAfter cloning the repository, you'll need to enter the modules directory and build each module.\r\n\r\n`$ cd modules`\r\n\r\nHow to install SMS module:\r\n\r\n`$ cd sms`\r\n`$mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to install IVR module:\r\n\r\n`$ cd ../ivr`\r\n`$ mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`\r\n\r\nHow to install Message-Campaign module:\r\n\r\n`$ cd ../message-campaign`\r\n`$ mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to install Care Services Discovery module:\r\n\r\n`$ cd ../csd`\r\n`$ mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`\r\n\r\n\r\n### EBODAC Module Installation\r\n\r\nThe EBODAC module can be found in our nexus repository. The easiest way to install it is to download  [the jar](http://nexus.motechproject.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=releases&g=org.motechproject&a=ebodac&v=RELEASE&e=jar) into the .motech/bundles directory and restart tomcat. If you choose to build the module yourself, it's located in the motech-implementations GitHub repository. Return to your home directory and clone the repo.\r\n\r\n\r\n`$ git clone https://github.com/motech-implementations/ebodac.git`\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter the EBODAC folder and install the module:\r\n\r\n`$ cd ebodac`\r\n`$ mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce complete, you'll want to copy your .motech/bundles directory into your production environment and restart tomcat.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n\r\nUnit and Integration tests can be found at:\r\n[Unit Tests & Integration Tests](https://github.com/motech-implementations/ebodac/tree/master/ebodac/src/test/java/org/motechproject/ebodac) \r\n[https://github.com/motech-implementations/ebodac/tree/master/booking-app/src/test](Booking App Unit Tests and Integration Tests)\r\n[https://github.com/motech-implementations/ebodac/tree/master/ebodac/src/test/java/org/motechproject/ebodac/uitest](UI Tests)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWe welcome contributions from the open source community.
